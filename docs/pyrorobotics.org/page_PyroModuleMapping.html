<i>This is an introduction to mapping and localization. This module provides an overview of the issues in how the robot can map a buildings layout, and know where it is. When completed, the reader should be ready to further explore these core ideas.</i>
<p>
<p>
<h1 width="804"> Pyro Module Mapping</h1>
<p>
This module is designed to allow a robot to create a map of its
environment.  This is done by combining Bayesian probabilities to
create an occupancy grid representation of the environment. Each
location in the occupancy grid contains a probability representing the
robot's best estimate of whether that location is occupied. A
probability of 0.5 indicates no knowledge about the location, a
probability of less than 0.5 indicates that it is likely to be
unoccupied, while a probability of greater than 0.5 indicates that it
is likely to be occupied.
<p>
In order for an occupancy grid based mapping system to be successful,
a robot must be able to accurately estimate its current position and
heading.  This ability is known as localization. In a simulator, it is
possible for the robot to know its exact location at all times, which
is a very unrealistic assumption in the real world.  The mapping
system given here does not do localization, but assumes that the
robot's estimate of its location is correct.  This works well in
simulation, but would need to be combined with a localization
technique to be successful in the real world.
<p>
This mapping system was written entirely in Python and the source can
be accessed in the <tt class="wiki">&#36;PYROBOT/map/</tt> directory.  There are two classes
that are necessary to use this module, the <tt class="wiki">pyrobot.map.lps.LPS</tt> and
<tt class="wiki">pyrobot.map.gps.GPS</tt> classes.  When used in combination, these two
classes provide a powerful, yet simple to use mapping system.
<p>
We will first examine the <b>LPS</b> class.  This class is used to gain
information about the <i>Local Perceptual Space</i>.  What this means is
that the LPS class reads and stores sensor information to create a
mini-map of the robot's immediate surroundings.  In the LPS, the robot
only maps what is clearly visible at the current time, and no memory of
past readings is stored.  
<p>
The LPS data is based on readings from a robot's range sensors.  Each
range sensor is assumed to return a distance to the nearest obstacle
in its vicinity.  If a range sensor returns its max distance, then we
can assume that it does not sense any obstacles in its
range. Therefore all of the locations along its line of perception
should be unoccupied. However we cannot make any assumptions about the
locations beyond its range. If a range sensor returns a value below
its max distance, then we can assume that there is an obstacle at this
distance.  In addition, we can assume that the space in front of this
distance is unoccupied, but again we can make no assumptions about
what lies beyond this distance.
<p>
The image below shows an example of the LPS for a simulated Pioneer
robot. The robot is represented as a red circle at the center of the
image and the attached blue square indicates its heading.  Recall that
a Pioneer robot is equipped with a set of 16 sonar sensors, which are
numbered 0-15 below.  The LPS is represented as a small occupancy
grid, where the color of each grid location indicates its probability
of being occupied: gray=unknown, white=unoccupied,
black=occupied. Each white and black location is inscribed with a
number indicating the sonar sensor that provided the information.  For
instance, sonars 4-5, 7-10, and 14 are all returning values at their
max distance, while the remaining sonars are indicating hits at
various distances from the robot.  Based on this LPS information, the
robot has mostly clear space on its right side, but is close to some
obstacles on its left side. 
<p>

<p>
The <b>GPS</b> class is slightly different.  This class is used to gain
information about the <i>Global Perceptual Space</i>.  This basically
means that, unlike the LPS class, the GPS class reads and stores
information about the world and adds this to an already existing map
of all previously visited areas of the world.  This is done by reading
sensor information directly from the LPS's local map and modifying the
corresponding locations in the GPS's global map.

to be running a graphical windows system on your computer, not just a
console window, for this demonstration.

We will begin with a skeleton of a mapping program. The following
brain is also provided as <tt class="wiki">JoystickMap</tt> in the loadable brains
directory.

To test out this brain, start up Pyro, first select the
Stage simulator and <tt class="wiki">everything.world</tt>, next select the robot
<tt class="wiki">Player6665.py</tt>, and finally select the brain <tt class="wiki">JoystickMap</tt>.
Once you press the <tt class="wiki">Run</tt> button, you can begin to move the robot
around the environment using the joystick.  
<p>
To control the joystick, shown below, drag the mouse from the center
of the circle toward the outside of the circle in the direction you
wish the robot to move.  In the example shown, the robot would be
moving forward right. The further you go toward the outer edge of the
circle, the faster the robot will move.  If you let go of the mouse
button the robot will stop.
<p>
<img src="../_dblank/images/joystick.gif">  
<p>
Notice that initially the GPS window is empty, but that the LPS window
will immediately display the robot's local view of the world.  If you
manage to joystick the robot throughout the entire environment, you'll
see that the GPS window's results will closely resemble the actual
environment as shown below.  Like the LPS, the GPS is also an
occupancy grid where the color of each grid location indicates its
probability of being occupied.
