<h1 width="804"> Robot Simulators</h1>
<p>
Pyro is designed to operate in a client/server fashion. This means
that a simulator will act as a server, and Pyro will connect onto
it. Because of this relationship, it is important to always shutdown
Pyro first. The simulator will stop automatically when you exit Pyro.
<p>
There are a number of simulators that can be used in conjunction with Pyro.
Each simulator has different strengths and weaknesses, so it is
important to understand these issues before selecting one to use.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Pyrobot Simulator</h2>
<p>
The Pyrobot simulator is the newest addition, and therefore is not as
well tested as the others.  It is written in python and includes the
ability to add lights and light sensors, which is not currently
possible in the other simulators described below.  Because it is
written in python it is the most portable of the simulation options.
However, the downside of this is that it can be slow if a complex
world with many objects and robots is desired.  It can also be run
without the GUI window to speed up experiments.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Stage Simulator</h2>
<p>
The Stage simulator is designed to work well with multiple robots and
can easily handle a complex world with many robots.  It is currently
undergoing a major upgrade and some aspects are unfinished.  For
instance, grippers, bumpers, and pan-tilt-zoom cameras are still
incomplete.  Lights and light sensors are a new addition that will
probably be included in the near future.  There are also plans to
allow it to run without the GUI window.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Gazebo Simulator</h2>
<p>
The Gazebo simulator, like the Stage simulator, is designed to work
efficiently for a population of robots.  It offers three-dimensional
graphics and generates both realistic sensor feedback and physically
plausible interactions between objects.  It can model sophisticated
robot devices such as arms and vision.  However, it is very resource
hungry, and can be tricky to build.  It is still early in its
development (version 0.5) and is currenly missing bumpers as well as
pan-tilt-zoom cameras.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Robocup Simulator</h2>
<p>
This has become a popular platform as a result of the many
competitions that are based on it.  Includes many soccer-related tools
and provides communication channels that no other simulations use.
The Pyro interface to this simulator is not yet polished, and the
simulated vision is still just a sketch of what it should be.
