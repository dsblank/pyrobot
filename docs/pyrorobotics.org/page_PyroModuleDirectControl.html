<i>This is an introduction to the most basic method of robotics programming: direct, or reactive control. This module provides an overview of such &quot;stateless&quot; controllers. When completed, the reader should be ready to explore more sophisticated controllers with state.</i>
<p>
<p>
<h1 width="804"> Direct/Reactive Control</h1>
<p>
In this module we will create robot controllers that have a close
coupling between perception and action.  This means that there is
limited state information and computation.  This is called direct or
reactive control.  The basic form of a direct control robot program is
shown below.  It must include a <tt class="wiki">step</tt> method.
<p>
<pre class="code">
# A simple brain
from pyrobot.brain import Brain
# Define the robot's brain class
class SimpleBrain(Brain):
   # Only method you have to define is the step method
   def step(self):
      self.robot.translate(0.3)     # go forward
# Create a brain for the robot
def INIT(engine):
   return SimpleBrain('SimpleBrain', engine)

<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Running the program</h2>
<p>
Before we explain the details of the above program, you may want to
run it. First, download the program to your home directory, and save
it as <tt class="wiki">SimpleBrainProgram.py</tt>.
<p>
To quickly start up Pyro on this program, you can do the following:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot -s StageSimulator -w tutorial.cfg -r Player6665 -b /home/<b>username</b>/SimpleBrainProgram.py &
</pre>
<p>
Where <b>username</b> is replaced with your username.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Understanding the SimpleBrain program</h2>
<p>
Recall that before you load the brain program into Pyro, you have
already loaded the robot driver (Player6665.py). This instantiates an
object of the specific robot class which is accessible to your program
using the identifier <tt class="wiki">robot</tt>. Every robot instance has to have a
brain object that defines the behavior of the robot. This is done by
extending a predefined class, called <tt class="wiki">Brain</tt>. In the program, this
is accomplished by the lines of code reproduced below and numbered for
reference:
<p>
<pre class="code">
1 from pyrobot.brain import Brain
2 
3 # Define the robot's brain class
4
5 class SimpleBrain(Brain):
6    # Only method you have to define is the step method
7
8    def step(self):
9       self.robot.translate(0.3)     # go forward
</pre>
<p>
Anything following the <tt class="wiki">#</tt> symbol is a python comment.
<p>
In order to extend the class <tt class="wiki">Brain</tt> you have to import the class
first as shown in line 1, and then extend it as shown in line 5. For
direct control, all one has to do is define the <tt class="wiki">step</tt> method
starting in line 8. In each cycle of a robot run, the <tt class="wiki">step</tt>
method is executed and this is where you will define commands for your
robot. For our example, we just wanted to have the robot move
forward. This is done by the command: 
<p>
<pre class="code">
    self.robot.translate(0.3) 
</pre> 
<p>
Once instantiated, the <tt class="wiki">Brain</tt> object (in this case, the
<tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt> object) can get the robot it controls by using the
<tt class="wiki">robot</tt> method. It is an accessor defined in the <tt class="wiki">Brain</tt>
class. Thus, calling the <tt class="wiki">translate</tt> method on that robot object
specifies the robot to move forward at speed <tt class="wiki">0.3</tt>.
<p>
The next few lines of code (shown below) create a specific instance of
<tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt> and specify the <tt class="wiki">robot</tt> which is controlled by
it.
<p>
<pre class="code">
# Create a brain for the robot
def INIT(engine):
   return SimpleBrain('SimpleBrain', engine)
</pre>
<p>
The <tt class="wiki">INIT</tt> method creates a brain instance to which the <i>engine</i>
it controls is specified. The command:
<p>
<pre class="code">
   SimpleBrain('SimpleBrain', engine)
</pre>
<p>
is a standard Python constructor call to create an instance of the
class, <tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt>. The constructor is inherited
from the <tt class="wiki">Brain</tt> class since
<tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt> itself doesn't define one. The constructor takes two
arguments (besides <i>self</i>), one specifying the name of the brain (in
our case <tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt>), and the other specifying the engine (the
variable <tt class="wiki">engine</tt>).
<p>
An engine is an abstraction that contains all of the pieces that go
together to run a robot, including the simulator (if using one), world
file, configuration information, robot, etc.
<p>
The <tt class="wiki">INIT</tt> method should return the newly created brain object
(hence the <i>return</i> statement).
<p>
When you load this brain program into Pyro and press the <tt class="wiki">Run</tt> or
<tt class="wiki">Step</tt> buttons in the Pyro window, the <tt class="wiki">step</tt> method is
executed on the robot, once for <tt class="wiki">Step</tt> and continuously for
<tt class="wiki">Run</tt>.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Exercise: Making sure that your robot has the proper brain</h2>
<p>
To ensure that you understand the program, let us find out if the
robot we specify does have the brain program you created. Modify the
<tt class="wiki">INIT</tt> method in <tt class="wiki">MySimpleBrain.py</tt> as shown below:
<p>
<pre class="code">
# Create a brain for the robot
def INIT(engine):
   brain = SimpleBrain('SimpleBrain', engine)
   print engine.robot.name + &quot; robot now has &quot; + brain.name + &quot; brain.&quot;
   return brain
</pre>
<p>
The <tt class="wiki">INIT</tt> method creates a <tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt> instance specifying
a name and the robot instance. Next, we simply print out the name of
the robot as well as the name of the brain that was assigned to
it. When run, the print statement will therefore confirm that the
robot we specified has the brain we just instantiated.
<p>
Edit and save the modified program. Reload the program into Pyro and
run it. Notice the output of the print statement that appears in the
console window. It should say:
<p>
<tt class="wiki">Player6665 robot now has SimpleBrain brain.</tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Exercises: Trying other motion commands</h2>
<p>
Modify the <tt class="wiki">step</tt> method of your program to do the following
tasks.  Be sure to save and press <tt class="wiki">Reload Brain</tt> button between
modifications.
<p>
<ol type="1"><li>Use <tt class="wiki">move</tt> instead of <tt class="wiki">translate</tt> and try different values.</li>
<li>Write a program for the robot to transcribes a circle.</li>
<li>Write a program that makes the robot do a little dance.</li>
</ol><p>
You may want to use the <tt class="wiki">sleep</tt> command from the Python <tt class="wiki">time</tt>
module. Import it using <tt class="wiki">from time import *</tt> and then to sleep for
x seconds, use the command <tt class="wiki">sleep(x)</tt>.
<p>
In addition to the movement commands based on a desired translate and
rotate, you can also command the robot by sending power values to each
wheel. For example:
<p>
<pre class="code">
robot.motors(.5, .25)
</pre>
<p>
will send 0.5 power to the left wheel and 0.25 to the right. Like
translate and rotate, these power levels go from -1 to +1. See if you
can fill out the equivalency chart below:
<p>
<table border="1"><tr><td colspan="2" align="center"> robot.move(t, r) </td><td colspan="2" align="center"> robot.motors(l, r) </td></tr>
<tr><td> t </td><td> r </td><td> l </td><td> r </td></tr>

<p>
<h2 width="804"> Using the Setup Method in a brain</h2>
<p>
Often, you may need to perform some initializations before a brain's
<tt class="wiki">step</tt> method assumes control. In Pyro brain programs, you can
make use of a method called, <tt class="wiki">setup</tt> to do this. The structure of
the brain program that uses a <tt class="wiki">setup</tt> method is shown below:
<p>
<pre class="code">
# A simple brain with a setup method
from pyrobot.brain import Brain
# Define the robot's brain class
class SimpleBrain2(Brain):
   # The setup method can be used to do initializations
   def setup(self):
      self.moveAmount = 0.3
   # The step method is the main behavior loop
   def step(self):
      self.robot.translate(self.moveAmount)     # go forward
# Create a brain for the robot
def INIT(engine):
   return SimpleBrain2('SimpleBrain2', engine)
</pre>
[<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/SimpleBrain2Program?action=raw"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;download</a>] [<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/SimpleBrain2Program?action=edit"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;edit</a>]
<p>
<p>
The program above initializes an instance variable in <tt class="wiki">setup</tt>
which is then referenced in the <tt class="wiki">step</tt> method. The <tt class="wiki">setup</tt>
method is executed once (as a post constructor operation) each time a
new instance of the <tt class="wiki">brain</tt> (sub)class is created. Thus, when the
<tt class="wiki">INIT</tt> method above creates an instance of <tt class="wiki">SimpleBrain</tt>, the
value of the <tt class="wiki">moveAmount</tt> field is set to 0.3.
<p>
You can access attributes of a brain from the Pyro command line, like
the variable <tt class="wiki">moveAmount</tt>, by typing: <tt class="wiki">brain.moveAmount</tt>
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Example: Transcribing a Figure Eight</h2>
<p>
Let us write a behavior for a robot to try to transcribe a figure eight
on the floor. The idea is to go around in a circle once and then,
after completing a circle, to switch the direction of rotation and go
around in the circle once again, thus completing a figure eight. The
program to do this behavior is shown below. Try loading this program
into a robot/simulator of your choice and see what happens.
<p>
<pre class="code">
from pyrobot.brain import Brain
from time import *
class fig8(Brain):
   # Try and transcribe a figure-8
   # initialize 
   def setup(self):
        self.rot = 0.3
        self.delay = 10.0
   # change direction and go about in a circle
   def step(self):
      robot = self.robot
      self.rot = self.rot*-1
      robot.move(0.3, self.rot)
      sleep(self.delay)
def INIT(engine):
   return fig8('fig8', engine)
</pre>
[<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/Figure8Program?action=raw"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;download</a>] [<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/Figure8Program?action=edit"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;edit</a>]
<p>
<p>
Most likely, the robot goes in a circular zig-zag, S-pattern.
This is because, we have to wait for the robot to transcribe a
complete circle before changing directions. You can fix this by
adjusting the <tt class="wiki">sleep</tt> command's argument, <tt class="wiki">self.delay</tt>, or by
adjusting the rate of rotation.  Go ahead and try different values
until you get the robot to transcribe a figure eight.
<p>
<p>
<h1 width="804"> Basic Sensing</h1>
<p>
In addition to motor commands (<tt class="wiki">translate</tt>, <tt class="wiki">rotate</tt>,
<tt class="wiki">move</tt>), you can also access the values reported by a robot's
sensors. Each robot comes equipped with a unique sensor suite. For
example, the Pioneer robots may have sonar sensors, a front bumper, a
gripper, and a camera. The Khepera robots have infrared sensors, light
sensors, and a camera.  The Pioneer's sonar sensors and the Khepera's
infrared sensors are both active range finders which can be used to
avoid obstacles. Although these two robots have different kinds of
sensors, Pyro unifies the way you will use them in your program.
However, it will be up to your program to interpret the sensor
data. For now we will demonstrate how to use the range sensors.  Go to
<a href="../page_Pyro_20Sensors/">Pyro Sensors</a> to review the sensor topologies and range sensing
commands introduced earlier.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Reading Pioneer sonar sensors</h2>
<p>
Recall that each Pioneer robot comes equipped with a set of 16 sonar
sensors.  Let's write a simple program that prints out the minimum and
maximum values of the front range sensors for a robot while it is
moving forward.
<p>
<pre class="code">
from pyrobot.brain import Brain
class Sensor(Brain):
    # print the min and max value of the front sensors while moving
    def step(self):
	self.move(0.5,0)
        self.front = [s.distance() for s in self.robot.range[&quot;front&quot;]]
        print &quot;min front: &quot;, min(self.front), &quot;max front: &quot;, max(self.front)
def INIT(engine):
   return Sensor('Sensor', engine)
</pre>
[<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/SensorProgram?action=raw"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;download</a>] [<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/SensorProgram?action=edit"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;edit</a>]
<p>
<p>
Download this program, load it, and then run it one step at a time
using the <b>Step</b> button in the Pyro window. You will see the front
range values printed in your console window.  By default the values
returned are in proportion to the robot's physical diameter. You can
move the robot around within the simulated world by left clicking the
mouse at a new location and you can adjust its heading by right
clicking the mouse.  Position the robot so it faces a wall a fair
distance away and then step it toward the wall and notice the values
of the sensors change. This will give you a good idea of the kind of
values reported depending on the distance to objects and will be
helpful in writing more complex behaviors.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Simple obstacle avoidance</h2>
<p>
Let us now combine sensing with movement to design a robot behavior
that senses its environments and moves about without bumping into
objects. The simplest algorithm to do this can be described as shown
below:
<p>
<pre class="code">
   if approaching an obstacle to the left side, turn right
   if approaching an obstacle to the right side, turn left
   else go forward
</pre>
<p>
The program shown below, implements the above behavior for a Pioneer
robot using its three front-left sensors (numbered 1, 2, and 3) and three
front-right sensors (numbered 4, 5, and 6). Recall from the example above
that sensor values in robot units decrease as the robot approaches an
obstacle. We have written the program below to be sensitive to
obstacles 1 robot unit away. Download this program and try running it
on a real or simulated Pioneer robot that is situated in a corridor.
<p>
<pre class="code">
from pyrobot.brain import Brain
class Avoid(Brain):
    def wander(self, minSide):
        # if approaching an obstacle to the left side, turn right
        if min([s.distance() for s in self.robot.range[&quot;front-left&quot;]]) &lt; minSide:
            self.move(0,-0.3)
        # if approaching an obstacle to the right side, turn left
        elif min([s.distance() for s in self.robot.range[&quot;front-right&quot;]]) &lt; minSide:
            self.move(0,0.3)
        else: # go forward
            self.move(0.5, 0)
    def step(self):
        self.wander(1)
def INIT(engine):
   return Avoid('Avoid', engine)
</pre>
[<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/AvoidProgram?action=raw"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;download</a>] [<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/AvoidProgram?action=edit"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;edit</a>]
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Exercise 3: Improving obstacle avoidance</h2>
<p>
Modify the obstacle avoidance program so that it responds
appropriately when the front sonar sensors detect an obstacle.  Be
sure to save and press the <tt class="wiki">Reload Brain</tt> button between
modifications.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Wall following</h2>
<p>
Below is a program that by default goes forward until it finds a wall
and then tries to follow the wall on the left. Download this program and
try running it on a robot.
<p>
<pre class="code">
from pyrobot.brain import Brain
class WallFollow(Brain):
    # follows walls on its left, ignores sonar sensors on its right
    def wallFollow(self, dist):
        frontLeft = self.robot.sonar[0][0].distance()
        backLeft = self.robot.sonar[0][15].distance()
        front = min([s.distance() for s in self.robot.sonar[0][2:6]])
        if front &lt; dist:
            print &quot;wall in front&quot;
            self.move(0,-0.5)
        elif (frontLeft &lt; dist or backLeft &lt; dist):
            print &quot;following:&quot;,
            if frontLeft &lt; backLeft:
                print &quot;turn slight away&quot;
                self.move(0.3,-0.1)
            else:
                print &quot;turn slight toward&quot;
                self.move(0.3,0.1)
        else:
            print &quot;find wall&quot;
            self.move(0.3,0)
    def step(self):
        self.wallFollow(1)
def INIT(engine):
   return WallFollow('WallFollow', engine)
</pre>
[<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/WallFollowProgram?action=raw"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;download</a>] [<a href="http://emergent.brynmawr.edu/emergent/WallFollowProgram?action=edit"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;edit</a>]
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Exercise 4: Improving wall following</h2>
<p>
Notice that when the robot is following a wall and reaches a corner,
the robot is able to turn the corner and continue following the wall.
However, if the robot is following a wall and it ends up in open
space, the robot loses the wall.  Try to modify the wall following
program so that the robot maintains contact with the wall and
continues following it even when it makes a sharp turn.  Be sure to
save and press the <tt class="wiki">Reload Brain</tt> button between modifications.
<p>
Also try to improve the program by enabling it to either follow walls
on the left or on the right.
