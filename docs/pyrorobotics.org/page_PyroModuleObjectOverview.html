<i>This is an introduction to the key abstractions used in the Pyro Robotics system. This module provides an exploration of the objects and their attributes, properties, and methods. When completed, the reader should be able to discuss the design of robotics controllers.</i>
<p>
<p>
<h1 width="804"> Overview of Pyro Objects</h1>
<p>
Pyro is written using object oriented programming (OOP) in Python. There are
four main classes in Pyro: <b>robot</b>, <b>brain</b>, <b>gui</b>, and <b>engine</b>. This module
will explore these objects and how they interact to form the core of
Pyro.
<p>
<p>
<h3 width="804"> pyrobot.robot</h3>
<p>
In order to do anything in Pyro, you will need a Pyro robot
instance. All robot types are extensions of <tt class="wiki">pyrobot.robot</tt>. The following
table shows the names of robots and their corresponding simulator or
hardware.
<p>
<table border="1"><tr><td> <b>Pyro Robot Name</b> </td><td> <b>Pyro Simulator Name</b> </td><td> <b>Robot Hardware</b> </td></tr>
<tr><td> <tt class="wiki">PyrobotRobot60000</tt> </td><td> Pyrobot<b></b>Simulator </td><td> Pioneer family </td></tr>
<tr><td> Player6665, Player6666 </td><td> Stage<b></b>Simulator, Gazebo<b></b>Simulator </td><td> Pioneer family, ER1, Khepera, B21R, etc. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Khepera, Hemisson </td><td> N/A </td><td> Khepera 1 and 2, Hemisson </td></tr>
<tr><td> <tt class="wiki">KheperaSimulated</tt> </td><td> Khepera<b></b>Simulator </td><td> N/A </td></tr>
<tr><td> <tt class="wiki">Robocup, RobocupTeamA, RobocupTeamB</tt> </td><td> Robocup<b></b>Simulator </td><td> N/A </td></tr>
<tr><td> <tt class="wiki">IntelliBrain-Bot</tt> </td><td> N/A </td><td> Intelli<b></b>Brain-Bot </td></tr>
<tr><td> <tt class="wiki">Roomba</tt> </td><td> N/A </td><td> Roomba </td></tr>
</table>Player also includes support for the Segway human transport, among
others. There is also an API for controlling Fred Martin's Handyboard
via a serial tether from Pyro. Researchers are also working on ports
to Mac OS X and Windows.
<p>
Each simulator is actually a different process, and each one has its
own method of talking to Pyro. For example, the simulator for the
Pyrobot robots uses ports, while <tt class="wiki">KheperaSimulated</tt> uses shared
memory.
<p>
It is generally a requirement to start up any simulator before
attempting to load the corresponding Pyro robot instance. On the other
hand, you should stop Pyro before stopping a simulator. Consider a
simulator to be the server, and Pyro the client. A server will stop when 
Pyro is stopped.
<p>
Robot objects are responsible for the details of interfacing with the
simulators and real hardware. All robots are defined in the
<tt class="wiki">pyrobot/robot/</tt> directory. For example, the following files have the details
of connecting onto the symbolic Pyrobot simulator, Player, and Khepera robots, respectively:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot/robot/symbolic.py
pyrobot/robot/player.py
pyrobot/robot/khepera.py
</pre>
<p>
For some robots, this involves many details. You may find that some of
the lowest-level details are in a lower-level directory of
pyrobot/robot/. But all robots get their core definition from:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot/robot/__init__.py
</pre>
<p>
Robot instances are passive objects: they only do things when a brain
or gui object tells them to. They command the motors of real
and simulated robots, but only as directed by a brain.
<p>
<p>
<h3 width="804"> pyrobot.brain</h3>
<p>
Each robot has exactly one brain. All brains are extensions of:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot/brain/__init__.py
</pre>
<p>
Brains are themselves extensions of threads. Thus, brains are capable
of running on their own, in their own process. Sometimes a brain may
have multiple <i>behaviors</i>, but they all run in a single thread.
<p>
Brains may operate continuously, but they do so one <tt class="wiki">step</tt> at a
time. Most brain threads call their step() methods about 10 times per
second. But you can implement your own brain that steps many thousands
of times a second.
<p>
If you have loops (<b>for</b> or <b>while</b> loops, for example) in
your step function, you may experience erratic behavior, either in the
robot or in the gui. Remember that step() is already in a loop, and
runs many times a second.
<p>
<p>
<h3 width="804"> pyrobot.gui</h3>
<p>
Each brain/robot pair has an associated graphical user interface, or
gui. The basic gui is defined in:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot/gui/__init__.py
</pre>
<p>
The gui is responsible for drawing things, if necessary. There are two
main gui's, and they must be indicated on the command line:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot -g tty     # A basic TTY console non-gui
pyrobot -g tk      # A Tk-based graphical interface
</pre>
<p>
The tty gui is a bare interface to provide interaction and control
over a slow connection, such as wireless. The tk gui will ask the
robot (and its devices) for data so that it can render visual
representations. Note that the tty GUI does not update devices' displays. 
If you run with the tty gui and wish to have graphical windows (for example, on 
a camera) then you will need an <tt class="wiki">camera.updateWindow()</tt> call in your
brain.
<p>
<p>
<h3 width="804"> pyrobot.engine</h3>
<p>
Finally, the engine is the last main object. The engine is designed as
a container for the brain/robot/gui trio (and some other overhead
objects). The engine is the place where the above objects can find
each other. You can find the engine definition in:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pyrobot/engine/__init__.py
</pre>
<p>
You can ignore engines, as they are not seen unless you want to write raw 
Python code to control multiple robots.
