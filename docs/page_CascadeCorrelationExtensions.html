Here are some possible extensions to the pyro Cascade-correlation implementation:
<p>
1. Add support for recurrent Cascade-correlation <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/sef/www/publications/rcc-tr.ps"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;Recurrent Cascade-correlation</a>
<p>
This would be very useful, but probably a bit involved.  The SRN implementation may not mess well with the Cascade-correlation implementation without a lot of work.  There are so many occasions where it would be nice to have more powerful recurrent neural network training algorithms.
<p>
2. Make sure that it works to use basic backprop instead of quickprop for weight updates.  Perhaps explore implementing an Rprop variant and seeing if it could be dropped in as a replacement for quickprop in cascade-correlation.  One would think that almost any batch training algorithm for simple feedforward networks could be used in conjunction with Cascade-correlation.  Historically, Quickprop was probably chosen because Fahlman also invented it and it is often much superior to backprop.  However, there may be other algorithms that work even better with Cascade-correlation.  It would be very interesting to see how much Cascade-correlation is hobbled by not using Quickprop and using backprop.  To do a fair test, one would have to adjust the patience and stagnation parameters quite a bit.
<p>
3. Add support for Candidates with different activation functions in the same candidate pool.  Currently, activation functions are a property of an entire layer in conx.  This item might be difficult because of that.  However, it might be very powerful to have a mixed activation function pool of candidate units.  Perhaps there has been some research about this and some papers could be found?
