<h1 width="804"> Pyro Workshop 2005</h1>
<p>
This is a planning page for the Pyro Workshop 2005. The workshop will
take place August 3 - 5, 2005 on the Swarthmore College campus, which
is just outside of Philadelphia.  Participants should plan to arrive
on the afternoon or evening of Tuesday, August 2.
<p>
The workshop will provide a dorm room for three nights (Tuesday
through Thursday). The dorm will be air conditioned and participants
will be provided with a pillow and linens.  However,
<b>you must bring your own towels</b>.
The workshop will also include breakfast and lunch
(Wednesday through Friday) and one dinner on Thursday evening.
Participants will be responsible for their own travel arrangements and
dinners on the other evenings.  Unfortunately we cannot provide extra
accommodations for friends or family, and we do not have access to the
dorms for any other dates.
<p>
