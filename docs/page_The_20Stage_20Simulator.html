<h1 width="804"> The Stage Simulator</h1>
<p>
Stage is part of the Player/Stage software package developed at the University of Southern California Robotics Research Lab and HRL Labs. Player is a device server that can be used to control robots just like Pyro. Stage is a multi-robot simulator that provides facilities for creating your own environments for experimenting with robots.
<p>
In this section, we will present the core features of Stage that you will need for building simulated worlds for your Pyro robot experiments. For more information on Player/Stage visit <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/"><img border="0" width="11" src="../wiki/img/moin-png">&nbsp;their web site</a>. There is extensive documentation available for Stage. You can find it either at the Player/Stage web site, or look in the <b>doc</b> folder of your Player/Stage installation on your computer.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> The Stage User Interface</h2>
<p>
The window below shows an example of a Stage simulated environment.
<p>
<img src="../_meeden/BeyondLegos/Images/Stage.jpg">
<p>
It contains several colored boxes as well as a pioneer-style robot.
<p>
In the Stage window, you can pan and zoom the world as well as
manipulate entities by using your mouse. You can click your mouse
buttons on the background or on the entities. The following table
summarizes various mouse click bindings and actions:
<p>
<b>Clicks on the background</b>
<table border="1"><tr><td> Left-click and drag </td><td> pans the window </td></tr>
<tr><td> Right-click and drag toward the center of the window</td><td> zooms in </td></tr>
<tr><td> Right-click and drag the mouse away from the center </td><td> zooms out</td></tr>
</table><p>
<b>Clicks on entities</b>
<table border="1"><tr><td> Left-click and drag</td><td> moves the entity</td></tr>
<tr><td> Right-click and drag</td><td> rotates the entity</td></tr>
</table><p>
Additionally, when you move your mouse over an active entity, like a
robot, you will also get a visualization of all the enabled sensors of
the entity.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Stage Entities</h2>
<p>
Every Stage world is made up of entities which can be <i>active</i> or
<i>passive</i>. Passive entities are also called <i>objects</i> in Stage
parlance. Active entities are also called <i>devices</i>. Objects, or
passive entities, are things like <b>models</b> and
<b>bitmaps</b>. Bitmaps are used to define fixed obstacles that can
represent building floor plans, walls, boulders, etc. and are loaded
from a PNM bitmap file. PNM is a portable any map file format.  Models
can be any size and can also be used to represent obstacles as well as
robot enclosures. For example, if you create a large models and then
place a robot inside it, the walls of the model will become the boundary
for the robot. If you placed smaller models inside the larger model
containing the robot, then those become blocks or obstacles. 
<p>
The other kind of entity one can have in a Stage world are
devices. For example, a robot is a device that can be positioned
anywhere in the world. Other devices include things like a gripper,
sonar, laser, ptz (pan-tilt-zoom camera), etc. Generally, these
devices will be mounted on a robot device. Stage has the capability of
defining composite devices. Thus you can define a robot that has a
gripper and sonars, or another one that has sonars and a PTZ camera,
etc.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Robot Devices</h2>
<p>
By convention, you typically define a simulated robot for Stage worlds
based on the actual robot that you have. You compose it to contain all
the devices the robot carries. Then, you can create several different
environments and include your robot device definition in it. For
example, the Stage software includes a file named <b>pioneer.inc</b>
that defines a typical pioneer-style robot with 16 sonars. This robot
can be used in any Stage world.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Creating a World</h2>
<p>
Once we have defined a robot, we can concentrate on creating a world
for it. Because Stage is currently undergoing a major upgrade, there
is still not much documentation on how to create worlds.  However, we
can demonstrate how the simple world shown above was created.
<p>
Creating a world in Stage involves creating two files.  The
first is the configuration file and always ends with a <b>.cfg</b>
extension.  For example, the file <b>tutorial.cfg</b> is shown below.
<p>
<pre class="code">
driver
(
        name &quot;stage&quot;
        provides [&quot;7000:simulation:0&quot;]
        plugin &quot;libstageplugin&quot;
        worldfile &quot;tutorial.world&quot;
)
driver
(
        name &quot;stage&quot;
        provides [&quot;position:0&quot; &quot;sonar:0&quot;]
        model &quot;Pioneer&quot;
)
</pre>
<p>
Next you must define the world file, which has a <b>.world</b>
extension.  This defines all the entities that will appear in the
world.  Each world file typically has the following:
<p>
<pre class="code">
   A specification of units.
   A specification of the Stage GUI window and the coordinate system.
   A list of all passive entities and their attributes.
   A list of all robots and their attributes.
</pre>
<p>
The tutorial world shown above is 5 meters wide and 5 meters high.  It
contains a blue rectangle, two green rectangles, and a red pioneer
robot.
<p>
All commands that specify entities in Stage worlds have the following syntax:
<pre class="code">
   &lt;entity_name&gt; ( &lt;attribute1&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ... &lt;attributeN&gt; &lt;valueN&gt;)
</pre>
<p>
Where &lt;entity_name&gt; is the name of the entity, and that is followed by
a list of attribute value pairs enclosed by parenthesis. You can
format the command on a single line or multiple lines. Attributes for
entities depend on the kind of entity. A rectangle (called a
<b>model</b>), may have a color, a position and an orientation.
<p>
<b>Specifying Units and Resolution</b>
<p>
<pre class="code">
   unit_length &quot;m&quot;
</pre>
<p>
The above command is the proper syntax for specifying units for
length. We have set it to meters. This is also the default in case you
do not specify any units. However, we recommend you do this. This
specification should also be consistent with your robot definition, so
you should be careful and fix this once and for all.  You can use
meters (<b>m</b>), centimeters (<b>cm</b>), or millimeters (<b>mm</b>)
for units of length and <b>degrees</b> or <b>radians</b> for specifying
angles. 
<p>
<b> The GUI Window and the Coordinate System</b>
<p>
You have to specify the size of the GUI window in pixels as well as
the center point and scale.
<p>
<pre class="code">
window
(
  size [540.000 580.000]
  center [0.000 0.000]
  scale 0.01    # 1 pixel = 0.01 meters
)
</pre>
<p>
Since our world will be 5x5 meters, at 0.01 meters/pixel, we will need
at least 500 pixels for the GUI window. We generally pad this so that
the window borders are also included.  The center of the window will
be considered the origin.
<p>
<b> Specifying Passive Entities</b>
<p>
In the world that we are building there are several objects. First
there is the outer box which encloses the environment.  This can be
defined as follows.
<p>
<pre class="code">
model 
(
  size [5.0 5.0]
  color &quot;white&quot;
  pose [0.000 0.000 0.000]
)
</pre>
<p>
In the above definition, the box is 5x5 meters, thus defining the
world boundary. It is colored white, and its position is defined by
three numbers which specify the x and y coordinates of the
<b>center</b> of the box and its orientation (in degrees). Thus the box
is centered at the point (0.0, 0.0 ) and its orientation is 0 (0
degrees lies along the positive x-axis).
<p>
Next there are a series of inner boxes which represent obstacles.
They can be defined as follows.
<p>
<pre class="code">
model 
(
  size [1.0 1.0]
  color &quot;blue&quot;
  pose [-2.000 2.000 0.000]
)
model 
(
  size [0.1 2.5]
  color &quot;green&quot;
  pose [0.000 -1.250 0.000]
)
model
(
  size [0.1 1.4]
  color &quot;green&quot;
  pose [0.650 0.000 90.000]
)
</pre>
<p>
<b> Specifying a robot</b>
<p>
We will use the definition of a pioneer robot:
<p>
<pre class="code">
pioneer2dx
(
  color &quot;red&quot;
  name &quot;Pioneer&quot;
  port 6665
  pose [-2.000 0.000 90.000]
)
</pre>
<p>
The <b>port</b> attribute is very important. This is the port number
that the driver program will use to connect to the robot and control
it.
<p>
<p>
<h2 width="804"> Exercise</h2>
<p>
Copy the following files from &#36;PYROBOT/plugins/worlds/Stage/ to your
home directory:
<p>
<pre class="code">
tutorial.cfg
tutorial.world
pioneer.inc
</pre>
<p>
Modify the world above so that the robot is pointing west when the
world is loaded into Stage. In order to get Pyro to load your version
of the world, be sure to press the &quot;Home&quot; button when the list of
worlds appears.
<p>
Try modifying some other attributes of the robot (like its
color). Then, create a red diamond-shaped box (a box oriented 45
degrees) as an obstacle in the environment. Move your mouse on the
robot and notice its sensors. Move the robot near the obstacle and try
the same thing. How would you create walls in this environment?
<p>
Now would be a good time to look at the other world files provided
there. This should give you a good idea of some other features of
Stage. Remember to browse the Stage Manual for more information on
Stage.
